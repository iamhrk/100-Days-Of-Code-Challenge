# 100_Days_Of_Code_Challenge - Daily Log
### Day 0: January 7, 2019
**Progress** - Got to know about the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
I always wanted to be obsessed with something life changing and challenging every time I do it.
I have found coding could be one such obsession. Sure, #100DaysOfCode would bring me that passion for challenging myself every single day.

### Day 1: January 8, 2019
**Progress** - Brought my old forgotten GitHub account back to life. Began with the #CSSin30days challenges by Brad Hussey.
Made some fancy buttons to improve my CSS skills.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019
**Progress** - Read an article about going from coding tutorials to building new projects out of your coding skills. Decided to my do my own coding above the tutorials challenges and to begin from there for making my own projects.

Read an article ["A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Pure CSS Images" by Michael Mangialardi](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2).

Out of that inspiration, I followed the article and coded my first pure CSS image!

### Day 5: January 12, 2019
**Progress** - Watched some tutorials for learning about Git and GitHub.
Installed Git to my Windows PC and played with some Git Commands.
Created and pushed some sample files to my Git Repo from the command line.
Forked the [100DaysOfCode Git Repo by Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code).
Read the rules and created my own custom repo [100_Days_Of_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/iamhrk/100_Days_Of_Code_Challenge).

Wrote my first MardDown file and committed to the repo as the log of #100DaysOfCode.
